# Roomer3D

A simple 3D Room Configurator and Designer. It was made in 40 hours with NO AI! 

Try out the demo: https://mohido.github.io/roomer3d-demo

The project isi part of the 2hrs30days challenge. However, the project became in MVP status in 20 days! Therefore, I decided to wrap things up at this point. 

The entire process was recorded and will be turned into a Youtube Video on my channel (https://youtube.com/@MohidoTech).
